# The surface of rapidly-rotating neutron stars

This repository accompanies the paper, "The surface of rapidly-rotating neutron stars: implications to neutron star parameter estimation", Hector O. Silva, George Pappas, Nicol√°s Yunes and Kent Yagi, [arXiv:2008.05565](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05565) (2020).

Here we provide a mathematica notebook that demonstrates the algorithm for locating the surface of a numerically constructed neutron star using the [RNS code](http://www.gravity.phys.uwm.edu/rns/), developed by [Stergioulas and Friedman (1995)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1995ApJ...444..306S), together with several demo RNS output files.
