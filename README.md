# The surface of rapidly-rotating neutron stars

This repository accompanies the paper, "The surface of rapidly-rotating neutron stars: implications to neutron star parameter estimation", Hector O. Silva, George Pappas, Nicol√°s Yunes and Kent Yagi, arxiv:xxxx-xxxxx (2020).

Here we provide a mathematica notebook that demonstrates the algorithm for locating the surface of a numerically constructed neutron star using the RNS code, developed by Stergioulas and Friedman, together with several demo RNS output files.
